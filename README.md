# Advent of Code

> Yet another Advent of Code solution collection, written in TypeScript.

## What is this?

My personal archive of solutions for [Eric Wastl's](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) Advent of Code puzzles.

This repo uses TypeScript + Heft + Jest for running solutions.

## Usage

### Run all solutions

This is a shortcut for `heft test`.

```console
yarn test
```

### Hack on one solution

This is a shortcut for `heft test --watch --test-path-pattern 2021/03`.

```console
yarn dev 2020/03
```
