# Advent of Code

> Yet another Advent of Code solution collection, written in javascript.

## Execution

Each solution exports a single class, which expects an input in the form of an array of strings.
There is no specific format to the output (generally, I spit it out to the console, since you're
usually racing against the clock, and I don't always come back and clean up).

Example:

    ./run 2018/04/Day04.js 2018/04/input.txt
